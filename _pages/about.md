Welcome to the website of GISP (Group of Intelligent Signal Processing, 智能信号处理组) Lab! GISP is a research laboratory founded by Dr. [Jian Guan](http://homepage.hrbeu.edu.cn/web/guanjian1) at [Harbin Engineering University (HEU)](http://www.hrbeu.edu.cn/). We focus on **audio signal processing**, **remote sensing image interpretation** and **artificial intelligence**. Our main interests are the basic theoretical and applied research of signal processing driven by artificial intelligence technologies, and our research includes: 
- Acoustic scene and event classification and detection;
- Acoustic channel modeling;
- Blind signal estimation;
- Speech enhancement;
- Remote sensing target detection/recognition;
- Sparse representation methods and applications;
- Deep learning theory and applications;

**Address**:  Room 4009, Building 21, 145 Nantong Street, Nangang District, Harbin, P. R. China (哈尔滨市南通大街145号哈尔滨工程大学21A4009)
